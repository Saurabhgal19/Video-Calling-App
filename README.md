# Video Calling App

Welcome to the Video Calling App ! This project utilizes WebRTC and WebSocket technologies for real-time communication. Below is a brief overview of these technologies:

## WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing directly between browsers without the need for plugins or additional software.

In this project, WebRTC is used to facilitate real-time communication between clients, allowing for features such as video calls, voice calls, and data sharing.

## WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers and can be used to establish a persistent, low-latency communication channel between the client and the server.

WebSocket is employed in this project to enable efficient and bi-directional communication between the server and clients. It ensures a seamless flow of real-time data updates and messages.



## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your browser supports WebRTC for the best experience.
- WebSocket requires a server that supports WebSocket connections. The server used in this pro


## Clone the Project
git clone https://github.com/Saurabhgal19/Video-Calling-App.git
cd your-project

## Server Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
-cd server

2. Start the server:
 -npm start

 ## Client Setup
 
 1. Open a new terminal window.
 2. Navigate to the client directory:

  cd client

  3. start the client

  npm run start

  This will start the client application, and you can view it in your web browser at http://localhost:3001.

Additional Notes
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the commands.

You can customize the server and client ports in their respective configuration files if needed.

Feel free to explore the project and make any necessary adjustments according to your requirements.

Happy coding!
